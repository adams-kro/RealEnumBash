# RealEnumBash
Linux post exploitation enumeration.

A post exploitation enumeration tool on Linux systems that uses minimalistic tools that come preinstalled in most Linux systems.

The entire script is in pure bash. 

It also outputs an HTML file that would be sent to a listening nodeJS server if needed. (coming soon) 

More updates coming soon.
